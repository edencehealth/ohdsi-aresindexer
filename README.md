[OHDSI/AresIndexer R package](https://github.com/OHDSI/AresIndexer), and
incorporates the [R script](https://github.com/OHDSI/Ares/blob/main/docs/index.md)
used to generate the proper data files for visualising a data source release in
the [Ares web application.](https://github.com/edencehealth/ohdsi-ares)

See the included `docker-compose.yml.example` for the configuration necessary
